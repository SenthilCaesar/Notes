We think, the Deep Neural Network approach implemented in the attached paper is promising and a good starting point for segmenting choroid plexus.
People have used this Deep Learning approach in their research for segmenting small organs like Pancreas, Hippocampus subfield and Lung nodules.

Problem:
Choroid plexus shows large inter-patient variation in term of shapes and sizes. 
Choroid Plexus boundary delineation is a difficult task due to shape-variability and poor tissue contrast.
Choroid Plexus segmentation constitutes a difficult task due to low tissue contrast and large variability in organ shape and size. 

Objective:
3D CNN which could learn the geometry of choroid plexus.
Incorporate anatomical prior knowledge about organ shape and location.
The model should give more importance to the choroid plexus channels/feature maps and also the location of the choroid plexus.
Train the network on smaller 3D regions centered around the choroid plexus instead of the whole T1 Brain MRI Image. This step avoids class imbalance.
Segmentation frameworks that rely on additional preceding object localization models to simplify the task into separate localization and subsequent segmentation steps.
Reduce the search space significantly by ruling out parts of scans that are very unlikely to contain choroid plexus, since choroid plexus is expected to be inside the ventricles.
An architecture for more non-rigid anatomical organs such as choroid plexus, because their topologies varies much, meaning there is a need to learn many low-resolution high-level abstract features.
